# Machine Learning Tutorial: Training and Testing Data

This repository contains a practice exercise for splitting data into train and test sets using the `train_test_split` function from the `sklearn.model_selection` module.

## Description

In this exercise, we will learn how to split data into training and testing sets for machine learning tasks. Splitting the data allows us to train our models on a subset of the data (the training set) and evaluate their performance on unseen data (the test set). This is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline to ensure that our models generalize well to new, unseen data.

## Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python 3
- scikit-learn (`sklearn`) library

You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn
